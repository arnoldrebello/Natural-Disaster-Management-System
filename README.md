# Natural-Disaster-Management-system
Our final year project was a system that had a mobile application, webpage and a desktop application. 
The Mobile application displayed weather, disaster news, to-do list offline and backed on the cloud, messaging service, and Maps to show locations of burnt areas and floods for the past 24 hours

To demonstrate live detection of fire and floods I created an Augmented Reality application that live streamed the camera inputs to the webpage and desktop application. 
It used a Machine Learning model to detect fire and floods to raise an alarm

Another Machine Learning model was integrated in the webpage to predict the possibility of fire/floods based on 6 parameters of the data.
